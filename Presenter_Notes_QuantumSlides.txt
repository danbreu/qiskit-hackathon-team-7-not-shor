Presentation Notes on Quantum Section

Slide1: Need the modulo function f(x) in a Quantum form
	- First give example with repeated application of the initial function results in a repeated state.  
		* This demonstrates  U^n has eigenstates 
		* not tehcycle so that |7>, |4>,... are also eigenstates
		* all eigenvalue 1 here, but we can choose a better set of states from these...

Slide 2: Form a choice set of bases
	- select a parameter e^(2piisk/r) and get a new eigenvalue
	- we now have a factor of r out front in a phase term, which we will intend to measure 

Slide 3: Make a representation of a known state
	- we don't know r, but we can take a superposition of |u_s> to form a specific eienvalue, |1>
	- Demonstrate phases cancel in in an example .

Slide 4: Note that U could be difficult to find
	- a simple representation of U limits the order of the algorithm
	- Repeated Squares, a standard classical motheod works here to achive poynomial time

Slide 5: Sample circuit
	- using U discussed we creat the superposition states equivelnt to |1> with f(x) applied
	- Use QFT to map phase/period to amplidude
	- comparning read-out probabilites gives us s/r
	- simple arythmatic then gives canidate r values

jupyter example:  Walk through example based on Qiskit textbook
	- cover final arythmatic in more detail with the example calculated.
